Encoder scheme: static ROT-N + dynamic XOR
------------------------------------------

Add 1 byte to the shellcode, the number of the rotation to be made.

1st Byte.
  - Store the number of the rotation as the 1st byte of the encoded shellcode.
  - To the 1rst byte of the shellcode, apply the rot-n operation.
  - Xor this last value, with the previous byte of the encoded shellcode,
    in this case, the value of the rot-n selected.
  - Add the new value as part of the encoded shellcode.

2nd..Nth Bytes
  - Rot-n the value of the actual byte of the shellcode.
  - Xor the value obtained with the value of the previous byte of the encoded shellcode.
  - Add the new value as part of the encoded shellcode.
